# Custom-System-Call-for-Linux

--> I have tried to make my own syscall for my linux system
--> This syscall takes 2 parameters:
    1. Pid of process to be searched
    2. file name where process information will be written.
    
--> This system asks user for a pid, searches the process with given pid and writes its information to a file whose name is given by user, all in kernel mode.
